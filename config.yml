# In order to properly use this, you will need to POST data, in JSON format to this plugin
# For the url to post to, see 'path: ' below
# If using PHP to post,
# use: http://php.net/manual/en/function.stream-context-create.php

# This extension works well with BoltForms
# You can have people sign up using the BoltForms, submit that data to the table specified here,
# And when you publish something new, send a post here with the format:
# {"name": "Name", "url": "URL", "type": {"number": 0}}
# i.e. For magazines:
# {"name": "The SomthingOrOther", "url": "http://google.com", "issue": {"number": 42}}

# This is the path in which you can access Notifications
# Direct data to (or visit) at "http://yourdomain.com" + path
# i.e. http://yourdomain.com/Notifications by default
path: /Notifications
# The table in your database that will be used to fetch subscription data
# MUST have:
#	id (primary key, auto-increment)
#	name (varchar)
#	email (varchar)
#	columns (each a boolean/tinyint(1))
# for sample, see example below
databaseTable: beta
from:
	email: the.country.gamer@gmail.com
	name: The Temportaist
# used to specify the subject.
type: build
columns: [Origin, Compression, WeepingAngles, Tardis]

example:
	path: /Notifications
	databaseTable: subscriptions
	from:
		email: johnsmith@gmail.com
		name: John Smith
	type: issue
	columns: [MagazineA, MagazineB, MagazineC]
